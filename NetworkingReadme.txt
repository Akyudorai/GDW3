INSTRUCTIONS:
Begin by running the server executable.  It should already be set to use localhost.  
After server begins running, open the client executable twice.  You will be prompted to choose a name.  It doesn't matter what name you choose.  Once you have chosen a name, you should connect to the server.  

If you successfully connect you should see a console log message in your server window and you should see a multiplayer option in the client menu.  You can join the networked game scene by selecting multiplayer and then choosing your character to load into the world.

CONTROLS:
WASD 		for movement
Mouse 		to look around
E 		to interact with NPCs
Spacebar 		to perform maneuvers
Escape		to open your in-game menu

NOTES:
> Chatbox is working, but it currently only sends messages to the game in the editor console as opposed to on screen.  
> Different maneuvers have different requirements.  i.e. You can only wallrun if you're in the air and moving a minimum speed, or rail grinding where you have to be above the rail to latch on.
